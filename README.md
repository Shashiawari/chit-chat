# chit-chat
Chit-Chat is a real-time chat application built with Node.js and Socket.io. The main features of this application include:

Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real time. This is achieved using Socket.io, which facilitates bi-directional communication between clients and the server.

Group Chat with Unique Room IDs: Users can create or join group chats by generating or sharing a unique room ID. This allows multiple users to communicate in a private group setting.

Simple and Responsive UI: The front end of the application is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

No Database Integration: The focus of this project is on real-time communication, so it doesn't include a database for storing messages or user data. Instead, the application maintains the state during the session.
